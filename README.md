# Hi, I’m Jishan Shiledar 👋
**Backend Developer | API Design | Distributed Systems | Databases**

- 🔭 I build robust, scalable backend systems: REST/gRPC APIs, microservices and data pipelines.
- 💼 Currently: _Your Company / Student / Freelancer_  
- 🛠 Tech: Java (Spring Boot) • Kotlin • Node.js (TypeScript) • Python (FastAPI) • PostgreSQL • Redis • Docker • Kubernetes • gRPC • Kafka

## About me
I focus on backend engineering: API design, database modeling, system reliability, and observability. I prefer small, maintainable services with thorough tests and reproducible builds.

**Core areas**
- API Design & Implementation (REST, OpenAPI, gRPC)
- Data & Storage (Postgres, Redis, query optimization)
- Observability & Testing (logging, metrics, integration tests)
- DevOps-friendly (Docker, GitHub Actions, CI pipelines)

## Featured Projects
> Backend-focused repositories demonstrating my API design, authentication, and system architecture skills.

- **[secure-auth-api](https://github.com/JishanShiledar/secure-auth-api)** — A production-grade REST API for user registration, login, JWT-based authentication, and role-based access control. Includes password hashing, refresh tokens, Docker setup, and PostgreSQL integration.

- **[task-manager-service](https://github.com/JishanShiledar/task-manager-service)** — A clean microservice that manages tasks with CRUD APIs, validation, pagination, and caching (Redis). Includes CI/CD (GitHub Actions) and integration tests.

- **[payment-gateway-simulator](https://github.com/JishanShiledar/payment-gateway-simulator)** — A mock payment API handling transactions, validation, error handling, and retry logic. Demonstrates robust design and failure recovery.

- **[event-driven-orders](https://github.com/JishanShiledar/event-driven-orders)** — Event-driven microservice using Kafka (or RabbitMQ) for order creation and status updates. Shows async communication, message queues, and clean service boundaries.

- **[monitoring-metrics-demo](https://github.com/JishanShiledar/monitoring-metrics-demo)** — Example service instrumented with Prometheus + Grafana + logging middleware for performance and request metrics.

## How I work
- Clear API contracts (OpenAPI/Proto) and migration-safe DB changes.
- Tests: unit + integration tests with CI on PRs.
- Small, focused commits and clear PR descriptions.

### Small wins to evaluate my work
- ✅ Reproducible Docker build + `docker-compose` for local dev  
- ✅ GitHub Actions CI that runs tests and lint on PRs  
- ✅ At least one integration test that runs with an in-memory or test DB
